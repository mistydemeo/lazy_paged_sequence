class LazyPagedSequence(object):
    """
    LazyPagedSequence provides a read-only list-like interface to paged data structures of known length.

    This class is intended to be used with paged resources in which pages may be expensive to return.
    Individual pages are cached, allowing for retrieval of individual items from a given page without repeated calls to the page function.

    Because the length of the sequence is fixed and is known before any pages are fetched, this class is suitable for use with Django's Paginator class without inducing undue overhead.

    For example, you could use this to wrap a REST API which returns results in discrete pages. The following example uses an imaginary Twitter client, which returns pages of tweets from a user's timeline::

        client = Twitter(**my_auth_details)
        # Fetch the tweet count ahead of time, so the sequence knows the length to report
        tweet_count = client.timeline(screen_name="mistydemeo")["total"]
        seq = LazyPagedSequence(
            lambda page, page_size: client.timeline(page=page, count=page_size, screen_name="mistydemeo")["tweets"],
            page_size=30, length=tweet_count
        )

        # now we can access the seq's contents just like a list:
        seq[0] #=> [{"text": "Here is the first tweet"}]
        seq[50:70] #=> [{"text": "..."} ... ]
    """

        :param function page_func: Function to be used to reify individual pages in the LazyPagedSequence's cache.
            page_func will be called with the following two functions:
                * page, an integer representing the page to produce (with the first page assumed to be 1).
                * page_size, an integer representing the size of the page to fetch; this will always be the same number.
        :param integer page_size: The size of the pages.
        :param integer length: The total length of all items in this sequence.
            This must be known ahead of time.
